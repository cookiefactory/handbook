# Tools 

## Slack 

Slack is our main communication tool. You can reach every team member of thomann.io via Slack.

### #announcements, #slackcast and #review-1

`#announcements` is used for must-have/must-know information. For example new employees starting, old ones leaving. Assembly documentation, sign ups for team events... Announcements made should always use the **@Channel** mention.

`#slackcast` is used for should-have/should-know/nice-to-have information. For example all-over business context, information on workshops/team events that happened, progress of team projects... Information provided here should either be posted without a mention or only use a weaker form such as mentioning a single team or **@hier**

Both channels are standard channels every newly added team member joins. If you haven't joined yet, please do so.

`#review-1` is used by all teams that have something new to present to everybody. Reviews take place every 4 weeks (check the team calendar for details) and are open to join for everybody. Each product team has a 20 minute slot to show the last weeks’ progress and share thoughts with people from other teams. Each product team must send at least one attendee apart from their PO. It will be their responsibility to update all not attending team members on what’s been shared.

### #thomann-universe, #tech-talk, #coffee-time and #bauchpinselei

`#thomann-universe` is used to connect all team members and all guests. It has no real communication purpose other than being able to contact all people we have in our slack workspace, regardless of being guests or workspace members.

Use the `#tech-talk` channel if you stumbled upon interesting news in tech that team members could be interested in.

If you find a really positive customer feedback, provide it to everybody in `#bauchpinselei`.

`#coffee-time` is a standard channel that helps you to connect to other team members. Every monday our coffee bot will match a new pair of team members to have a call in the current week.

Do not use **@channel** or **@here** mentions in these three channels. If you have important news that justify pinging everyone better choose #announcements or #slackcast.

### #opsteam-support and #datateam-support

Any questions regarding our infrastructure or how to track data and receive it? Both channels help you to quickly connect with team members of our operations and of our data team. Remember: there are no stupid questions. If you’re asking yourself a question, chances are high someone else can also profit from an answer.

If your question is urgent, you can use the @datateam and @opsteam mentions. If you have a specific request it's best to put it in a Jira ticket.

## Kenjo

Kenjo is our people & culture tool. It's used for all people-related tasks:
- requesting vacation
- calling in sick
- setting and tracking unit/community/team/personal goals
- download paychecks
- etc.

## Google Workplace

We collaborate on documents, spreadsheets and presentations via Google Workplace. That's also were you find your email inbox and your calendar. 

## Our philosophy about tools - new or current

## Jira

Jira is the place to collect tasks, projects, visions, bugs and user problems. Every member of thomann.io has access to check what we're working on and which steps we will take to reach our goals.

### Product Backlog

The product backlog contains all tasks for our product teams on a higher level. If it's not daily business the teams get their tasks from this backlog keeping the balance between internal stakeholder requests and solving customer problems. You can find it under the name "epic flow" and use the quick filters to distinguish between stakeholder projects, teams and more.

All our backlogs and boards are prioritized based on value for our users, segment size of users, predicted effect on our northstar metric and effort estimation.

The product lead is responsible for gathering the backlog items, grooming them and setting a priority.

### Team Boards and Backlogs

Each team has their own board and backlog. Just search for the team's name in the board section and you'll find it. Depending on the team's way of work it's either a scrum or a kanban board, some teams also have both.

The team product owners are responsible for gathering the backlog items from the product backlog, refining them with the team and setting a priority.
