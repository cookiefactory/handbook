# How we work 

## remote, distributed, together (guidelines, tooling)

Our main communication tool is **Slack**. Use slack status to **communicate your availability**. The easiest way is on-/offline. We provide a few other status messages, e.g. when you’re in a meeting, in a work tunnel, on break, sick or on vacation. Make sure to set them accordingly.

### When we work

We rely on self-organized groups of individuals that know when and how to get their best work done. A team also decides how much overlap they need to collaborate. 

We aim for 40 hours a week (for a full-time employee). This helps us focus on what's important. Each team and individual know best when to work. We have no fixed schedule.

We emphasize a healthy routine for everyone. That includes having a life outside of work and getting a good amount of sleep. That's the best productivity hack you can get. 

There may be exceptions, but they stay exceptions. We act proactive. If we exceed these hours regularly, we figure out the issue and solve it. That can mean recruiting more people, fixing a flawed process, or something else. 

### Iterations

Most teams plan and work in **iterations of 2 weeks** and release as often as possible. **“Done”** means our customers use it.

### Sync

Every team has some form of a **daily or weekly update meeting**. All of thomann.io gathers once a month for the Assembly. This is our all-hands update format.

### Demos

Our product teams **show their progress and achievements** each iteration to product management. They invite the whole team when useful.

#### Review 1

- Tuesdays 14-15.00 every 4 weeks, already scheduled in the calendar. You'll find the call link in the calendar appointment.
- Goal of the appointment: Exchange knowledge and feedback between teams and units.
- Each product team has a 20 minute slot to show the last weeks’ progress and share thoughts with people from other teams.
- Each product team must send at least one attendee apart from their PO. It will be their responsibility to update all not attending team members on what’s been shared.
- We have a slack channel for this format already which we will continue to use.

#### Review 2

- Voluntarily, every Wednesday 14-15.00, already scheduled in the calendar.
- Goal of the appointment: Product Lead feedback on iteration results.
- Will take place in a new slack channel **#review-2**. Just join our head of product in the huddle at the according times.

### Reflection

Each team is obligated to **reflect regularly.** Retrospectives and project recaps are our means of choice. If your team does not have a coach of its own, please contact the agile unit for support. 

### Onboarding buddies

**Your buddy will help you find your way around the thomann.io.**

They will coordinate your first meetings and introduce you to the people you’ll work close with everyday. 

You and your buddy will hold **regular feedback sessions** in **the first 6 months** and beyond to make sure you can arrive in your new role properly. 

**Your buddy is the #1 go-to person** for any questions. By the way, there are no stupid questions. But you already know this.

In addition, people & culture will ask you for feedback and any concerns during your first 6 months.
