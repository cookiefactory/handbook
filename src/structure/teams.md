# Teams

## Product teams

- B2C as customers
- data-driven work
- finding metrics
- focusing on goals

Product teams combine roles from engineering, product, uiux, and agile to own parts of our webshop and app. They use service teams to succeed in their projects.

## Service teams

- engineers and other internal roles as customers
- improve development experience
- support product teams in cross-functionality

Service teams usually have their competency in one unit. Examples are our platform team, operations, data or people & culture. They support our product teams in working end-to-end.

**Important note:** When service teams grow, we'll add their roles to product teams where it makes sense. This enables more autonomous work within the product teams.

## Switching teams

Should a team member not feel comfortable (like really uncomfortable) with their team, there's an option to switch teams. The highest priority here is to look for direct communication. There are some requirements for finding/forming a new team:

1. Functioning teams must endure
2. Teams must be able to develop features for their focus topic
3. Teams shall span multiple locations
4. A new team constellation shall improve our product development
