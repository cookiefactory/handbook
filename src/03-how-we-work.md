# How we work 

## remote, distributed, together (guidelines, tooling)

Our main communication tool is **Slack**. Use slack status to **communicate your availability**. The easiest way is on-/offline. We provide a few other status messages, e.g. when you’re in a meeting, in a work tunnel, on break, sick or on vacation. Make sure to set them accordingly. 

## Team manifesto

To figure out what to do when things get tough, we created a team manifesto. Look at it as a little law book. It’s great if you don’t need it. But it’s cool to have it to settle arguments. It contains three sections.

Our mission at Thomann is **to enable and inspire people to speak music, everywhere**. As a part of Thomann we first and foremost represent our organization's core values.

To contribute to our company's mission:

**We create the most inspiring online shopping experience for musicians worldwide.**

The baseline for this mission is

- to create empowered product teams
- to create innovative products and solutions
- to continuously deliver value for our organization

We are one team and are passionate about thomann.de and our app. We put our shared goals first and are proud of our work from day one.

### How we communicate

- **Honest & direct:** We communicate honestly, openly, benevolent and transparent. We always tackle problems and challenges by being respectful, technical and positive. The direct approach is the best approach.
- **Sharing knowledge:** If something's for the world to come, document it!
- **Give feedback:** We share positive feedback with the largest group possible: Unit → Team → 1:1. We share negative feedback with the smallest group possible: 1:1 → Team → Unit. Every team member is allowed to give feedback in any direction (360°). We reflect regularly and continuously on all levels. 
- **No elephants or beating around bushes:** This should not exist. If it does, however, we approach somebody who is able to support us handling and solving the situation. 

### Our way of work

- **Let's be pioneers:** We take a step further than other e-commerce companies. Our ideas, features, team and ways of work shall be an inspiration for others and set the bar high.
- **Minimal change:** The smallest change shall be validated with real customers as fast as possible. A great foundation is better than a house no one wants to live in.
- **Have and feedback ideas:** Each idea helps us improve. Therefore, they shall always be put in our Feedback Hub. Consult others and remember: the inside of the box might only be one perspective.
- **Take ownership:** We work driven by solutions, quality, success and data. The Web Team owns the product and code. It is responsible and accountable. Each role contributes with their own skills.
- **Consult others:** If we are unsure about making a decision, we seek help from experienced team members. This also helps us to feedback ideas and prepare them for our Feedback Hub. All team members are consultants for each other.
- **Work in teams:** Our way of work is inspired by established processes. However, we own and adjust them when needed. We bank on long-term, cross-functional teams working location- and platform-independent.
- **One remote, all remote:** A good meeting provides equal chances for every participant. If one team member joins remotely, all other participants shall join the meeting remotely and separately. 

### No Gos

- **Hallway radio:** We avoid hidden priorities, agendas, and the distribution of wet ink. What counts is communicated transparently and explicitly.
- **Getting stuck with your mindset:** We avoid being biased. There is no "we've always done it this way" or "this will never work" without valid data and experience.
- **Hidden feelings:** We don't hide our feelings. Bad feelings tend to bottle up. We don't want you to listen to My Chemical Romance.
- **Complexity:** We avoid unnecessary complexity on all levels. The most obvious solution tends to be the most reliable.
- **Finger pointing:** It's not your fault. Mistakes happen all the time. We support each other to have them only happen once and to improve ourselves. Nothing's just someone else's problem.
- **Talking about "the others:"** We are one large team - the Web Team. Even though we all have different roles, there are no "others" in our team. We share one common goal and every team member contributes with their skills. 
- **Head monopolies:** We don't like them. Each head can fit some more of the other team members' knowledge.

### When we work

We rely on self-organized groups of individuals that know when and how to get their best work done. A team also decides how much overlap they need to collaborate. 

We aim for 40 hours a week (for a full-time employee). This helps us focus on what's important. Each team and individual know best when to work. We have no fixed schedule.

We emphasize a healthy routine for everyone. That includes having a life outside of work and getting a good amount of sleep. That's the best productivity hack you can get. 

There may be exceptions, but they stay exceptions. We act proactive. If we exceed these hours regularly, we figure out the issue and solve it. That can mean recruiting more people, fixing a flawed process, or something else. 

### Iterations

Most teams plan and work in **iterations of 2 weeks** and release as often as possible. **“Done”** means our customers use it.

### Sync

Every team has some form of a **daily or weekly update meeting**. All of thomann.io gathers once a month for the Assembly. This is our all-hands update format.

### Demos

Our product teams **show their progress and achievements** each iteration to product management. They invite the whole team when useful.

#### Review 1

- Tuesdays 14-15.00 every 4 weeks, already scheduled in the calendar. You'll find the call link in the calendar appointment.
- Goal of the appointment: Exchange knowledge and feedback between teams and units.
- Each product team has a 20 minute slot to show the last weeks’ progress and share thoughts with people from other teams.
- Each product team must send at least one attendee apart from their PO. It will be their responsibility to update all not attending team members on what’s been shared.
- We have a slack channel for this format already which we will continue to use.

#### Review 2

- Voluntarily, every Wednesday 14-15.00, already scheduled in the calendar.
- Goal of the appointment: Product Lead feedback on iteration results.
- Will take place in a new slack channel **#review-2**. Just join our head of product in the huddle at the according times.

### Reflection

Each team is obligated to **reflect regularly.** Retrospectives and project recaps are our means of choice. If your team does not have a coach of its own, please contact the agile unit for support. 

### Onboarding buddies

**Your buddy will help you find your way around the thomann.io.**

They will coordinate your first meetings and introduce you to the people you’ll work close with everyday. 

You and your buddy will hold **regular feedback sessions** in **the first 6 months** and beyond to make sure you can arrive in your new role properly. 

**Your buddy is the #1 go-to person** for any questions. By the way, there are no stupid questions. But you already know this.

In addition, people & culture will ask you for feedback and any concerns during your first 6 months.
