# Thomann DNA

This part is still in the works. It's a larger, organization-wide project. 

But even though it's not written down officially, that's what you can observe at Thomann:
1. It's a passionate industry. Many of us are musicians or have a hobby related to music. Music is the language of peace and community. That's why we love it.
2. Strolling around our campus in Treppendorf, you'll meet a lot of customers. It's their little D*sney Land, and we're doing everything to make their visit unforgettable.
3. You don't have to be musically to work with us. But we can't guarantee you'll never buy your first instrument anyway.
4. If it's good for our customers, it's good for us. We wouldn't be where we are right now, if it was for shareholders.
