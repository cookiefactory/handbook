## Yearly kickoff

Each year has its own story. Our yearly kickoff is an all-hands meeting to tell the team what challenges to solve.

## Assembly 

Our all-hands monthly meeting. See details on the next slide.

The Assembly takes place once a month, usually on the last Thursday at 14:00 (sometimes it’s the first Thursday of the next month, check the shared calendar). The regarding Zoom or Google Meet link will be shared in the Thomann calendar. The meeting is recorded and shared for everybody who’s missing out. The Assembly and the informations shared in the meeting are obligatory for every team member.

Changes in date and time will be announced early on. The assembly follows this agenda:

### Product

The Epic Flow is our all-over backlog. It shows the projects and the progress of the product teams.
During our Assembly, we go through the latest updates. So every team member is kept up-to-date.

### thomann.io

Is there a team event upcoming? Will there be a workshop? Did a team member achieve something special? All news regarding thomann.io are shared in this section of the meeting.

### Feedback

After each Assembly the team is provided a feedback form. It asks how happy you were in the last month. You can also provide personal feedback. 
The team averages are shown in the beginning of the next Assembly.

### Questions

Is there anything that still needs clarification? That’s where you can ask. Don’t be shy, don’t hesitate to ask anything you’d like to know. If there is an answer to your question, you’ll get it here.

## DevCamp & DataCamp

A multi-day hackathon-style team event. We use it to work on projects we usually don’t, to design-think and prototype new ideas and to add a little more love to our web shop.

## Open Space

A day for team-wide knowledge sharing. Bring in your own ideas and topics. The usual tracks are tech, product, meta, music.

## Christmas Business

October 15 marks the traditional start of Christmas business in e-commerce. This is when we enter the phase of showing our prettiest faces and a polished user experience.
